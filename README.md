# Expected Outcome

The goal of this project is to create a seamless, intelligent tool that enhances content creation by automatically recommending background music that matches the mood and context of the user's media. By the end of development, the app should:

## Core Outcomes/Features

### Effortless Song Discovery
- Users can upload media and receive instant, relevant background music suggestions without manual searching.

### Mood-Matching Recommendations
- The app accurately analyzes the media to detect mood, tone, or tempo and recommends music that enhances the overall feel.

### Intelligence & Relevance
- Suggestions are personalized to the media's emotional or aesthetic characteristics.
- Songs are pulled from a curated or API-connected library (e.g., Spotify, YouTube Audio Library, etc.).

## Target Users & Their Needs

- **Social Media Creators**
- **Students / Hobbyists**

## User Impact

- Speeds up the creative process for social media posts, reels, and promotional content.
- Improves the emotional engagement of content through well-matched background music.
- Helps creators stay on-trend with music choices that resonate with their audience.

| Mood Detection Accuracy | Interpreting mood from visuals/audio is subjective and depends on high-quality training data and models. |
| Handling Diverse Media  | Users may upload anything from vibrant reels to grayscale photos â€” accurate analysis across formats might be tricky. |
| Feature Implementation  | Real-time music playing with full or part audio and volume control.     |
| Scene Understanding     | Automatically identifying "what's happening" in an image (e.g., beach scene vs. party) will require advanced ML/AI techniques. |
