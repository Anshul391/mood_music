# MoodMusic Pro

## Overview
MoodMusic Pro is an AI-powered web app that recommends music based on your mood, detected from a photo, and your preferences (genre, language, activity). The app uses Azure Computer Vision and Azure OpenAI for mood detection, and integrates with the Spotify API to provide real song previews. The UI/UX is modern, compact, and responsive.
